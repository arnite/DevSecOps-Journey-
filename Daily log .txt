TODAY'S LOG

so today i learnt about "linux account groups and user's permissions"
Working with Vim editor...
and i also learnt some extra commands in linux system...
i also learnt how to use the vim code editor, how to read, edit and other stuffs on vim editor 
I also learnt why CLI is more sort after in DevSecOps...for one, it is more efficient, more easier to use for bulk operations and it is also more powerful in general 

Sad to say i won't be doing learning DevSecOps again, simply because i don't want to dilute my efforts i want to solely focus on building backend applications, i wanto to be a specialist at that and that will require me to master it by repitition, so in order words
all my spare time will geared towards perfecting my backend craft.
