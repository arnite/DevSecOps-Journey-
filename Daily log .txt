TODAY'S LOG

so today i learnt about "linux account groups and user's permissions"
Working with Vim editor...
and i also learnt some extra commands in linux system...
i also learnt how to use the vim code editor, how to read, edit and other stuffs on vim editor 
I also learnt why CLI is more sort after in DevSecOps...for one, it is more efficient, more easier to use for bulk operations and it is also more powerful in general 

Sad to say i won't be doing learning DevSecOps again, simply because i don't want to dilute my efforts i want to solely focus on building backend applications, i wanto to be a specialist at that and that will require me to master it by repitition, so in order words
all my spare time will geared towards perfecting my backend craft. 

Today's LOG
so i have been applying for jobs lately, and i have found out that i will have to learn DEVOPS practices just enough to containarize and deploy my own applications, seems that course i downloaded will still be useful..
why did i come to this conclusion? well in some of the job posts, some of the requirements asided the obvious backend stuffs, i am also seeing some devops requirements, stuffs like CI/CD pipelines, monitoring, IAC (infrstructure as code) e.t.c, so i can't afford to be left behind, also heard that some companies are adopting the "You build it, you deploy it" approach..

Today's LOG
i learnt some SQl today, i learnt about JOINT and it's types, also learnt sorting, where, some CRUD operations, revised some basic syntax just to reinforce memory and lastly i learnt indexing, prior to now, the only type of indexing i knew was that of nosql, mongoDB to be precise.
